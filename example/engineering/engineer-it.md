This task requires the engineer to thoroughly investigate and resolve any issues that arise during
development or deployment. The goal is to push the limits of what is possible with the technology,
even if it means going above and beyond what is currently considered "normal" engineering practices.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

* All issues are resolved, regardless of complexity or time required
* Solutions are implemented in a way that improves overall system performance, scalability, or reliability
* The engineer must demonstrate exceptional problem-solving skills and creativity
* Documentation for all changes made is thorough and easy to understand

**Notes:**

* Please do not assign this task to anyone without discussing it with the team lead first.
* If you are unsure about any aspect of this task, please reach out to coder3 for guidance.

This ticket requires a serious amount of engineering expertise and creativity. The engineer assigned
to this task should be comfortable working outside their normal comfort zone and should be willing
to take calculated risks to deliver results.
